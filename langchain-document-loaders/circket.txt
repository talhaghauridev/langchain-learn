Cricket on the Field

The sun is bright, the pitch is set,
The players take their place—and yet,
The crowd is loud, the cheers begin,
It’s time to bowl, it’s time to win!

The bat swings wide, the ball takes flight,
A six is scored—what a delight!
The fielders chase with all their might,
Each run a thrill, each catch so tight.

The bowler spins, the batter waits,
Tension builds at heaven’s gates.
The stumps go flying—what a sight!
A game of skill, of strength, of fight.

With every over, stories grow,
In cricket's world, emotions flow.
From gully to the boundary line,
Cricket’s magic will always shine.
